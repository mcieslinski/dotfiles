Info about this package
=======================
Nobody will probably ever read this file or use this stuff, but...

I created this package in order to more easily set up my Debian/Ubuntu computers/VMs when
I have reason to perform a refresh on my system or when I get a new system. These are a
number of settings that I have found to be very helpful as well as scripts to perform
various tasks for which I did not want to download some extra software.


Setting up the shell environment
================================
For bash-based debian systems, run distribute.sh
    - This will back up existing files to their .bak counterparts
    - If you regret your decision/doubt my wisdom, run restore.sh
